Hi there. 👋
Welcome! I'm CJ, an emerging junior developer, with an unconventional past and an unshakeable drive to build things that matter. 

# Building Code. Shifting Culture. 🚀 🌎

I'm new to code, but not to complexity.  
My background has trained me to see patterns in chaos, connect seemingly unrelated pieces, and solve high stakes problems under pressure. 
Now, I'm channeling that same strategic mind into **tech** - where curiosity meets capability. 

## Why Tech? 

Because its not just the future - it's *my* future.💡 ⌨
As someone who navigates the world differently (I'm legally blind), technology is how I engage, build, connect, and contribute.  
I don't see coding as a task. 
I hear it as a language - a dynamic form of architecture where empathy, accessibilty, and itelligence can shape real world solutions. 

Tech is the space where I turn lived experience into *design intuition*. 
Where problem soliving isn't theoretical, it's personal. 
Where ethics, accessibility, and human-centered design aren't add-ons, they're the blueprint.

## What I'm Learning & Building ⚡️ 📚
- **MTML & CSS**: Building clean, accessible, responsive designs.
- **JavaScript (Foundations)**:
Learning how to think like a developer and make pages come alive.
- **Accessibility First**: Designing with vision differences in mind -
because I live it.
- **Version Control**: Navigating Git/Github as I build a foundation of collaboration.
- **Curiosity in Motion**: Exploring a long-term intrest in **AI ethics**, inclusive design,
and tech for social good.

## Projects With Purpose 🌱 ❤️‍🩹
My repositories may be humble now, 
but every one of them is a piece of a bigger intention:
To grow, to collaborate, and to build tools that are intelligent, 
ethical, and *alive with meaning*. 

I'll be documenting my progress in the public view - not because it is perfect, 
but because the prgress **is the product**. 

## What I Bring 🔥 🧠

- A unique, systems-oriented brain shaped by real-world survival
- Precision, patience, and pattern recopgnition honed from high-pressure problem solving
- A genuine hunger to contribute, not just to consume
- An ability to design for margins because I *live* in them
- Compassion-led logic - I believe the most powerful tech is also the most humane

## Let's Build Something That Matters 💬 ⚙️

If your working on a problem involving:
- Ethical tech
- Accessibility
- Trauma-informed design
- Learning in public
- Or you just want to build with someone who brings a **fresh lens and fierce commitment**

Reach out. I'm here to learn, contribute, and *craft solutions that resonate*.

**Tech is my path forward. My code might still be young - but my vision is wise.**
Watch this space. 👀
